# Github actions testing

I created this _repository_ to try out Github actions after going through some courses in [Github skills](https://skills.github.com/).

Try:

- Creating an Issue
  - The Issue will also get deleted after 5 minutes without activity
- Creating a pull request with main as `base`
  - ESLint will check the code to merge into main
  - Remark will check the MD about to be merged into main
- Push to `error` branch
